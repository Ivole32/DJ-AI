I spent the first 1–2 hours mainly searching for a solid dataset to build this project on. After trying several options, I found the **djmix-dataset** (https://github.com/mir-aidj/djmix-dataset
), which turned out to be a very strong foundation.

Since the documentation was quite limited, I had to explore the data structure myself to understand how everything is stored. During this process, I discovered that the track IDs are actually YouTube video IDs, which is a big advantage because it allows me to extract additional features like BPM, tempo, and other audio characteristics in the future.

Next, I will focus on building a simple and efficient Python-based backend API that supports track search and recommendations. I’m planning to use **FastAPI** together with **Pydantic**, and either integrate an existing **search library** or implement a lightweight custom solution.
