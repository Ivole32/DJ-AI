Over the past hours, I’ve been focusing heavily on the backend of the project and laying down a solid foundation.

## 🔍 Track Search

I implemented a track search system that allows tracks to be found reliably. During development, I paid close attention to clean code, clear structure, and proper separation of concerns to keep the system maintainable and extensible.

## 🔮 Track Prediction

In addition to search, I built an initial track prediction system that analyzes existing track sequences and predicts which tracks are likely to be played next. This currently works on a heuristic/statistical basis and serves as a foundation for more advanced models in the future.

## 🧠 Backend Architecture

A lot of effort went into keeping the backend organized and well-structured:

- Clear module separation

- Reusable services and utilities

- Proper validation and error handling

- Performance considerations (e.g. Redis)

## 🚧 Next Steps

The next planned steps are:

- Building the frontend

- Implementing proper prediction models (ML-based)

- Connecting predictions and search results to the UI

Overall, the focus so far has been on correctness, maintainability, and creating a strong backend foundation to build upon.
