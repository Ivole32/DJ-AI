## 🚀 Machine Learning Model

In the past days, I started implementing a real machine learning model for track prediction and building a solid base of training data. The model is now functional and designed to serve as a reliable foundation for future improvements and experiments.

I created a fully working submodule dedicated to the machine learning model, making it possible to set up, train, and use the model independently.

## 🎧 Track Analyzer

Alongside the ML model, I implemented a separate analyzer module that processes YouTube tracks provided by
[mir-aidj/djmix-dataset](https://github.com/mir-aidj/djmix-dataset)
.

The analyzer automatically downloads the tracks from YouTube and extracts the required data for further processing.

All processed data is now stored separately in /dataset, which greatly improves project structure and maintainability.

## 🧹 Code Quality & Documentation

A significant amount of time was spent on documenting the code, improving readability, and cleaning up internal structures. This was an important step to ensure long-term maintainability and stability.

## 🖥️ Frontend & Backend Status

Work on the frontend and backend has already been ongoing for quite some time. However, these components have not been released yet, as the codebase is currently undocumented and unstable. They will be published once the overall structure is more mature and reliable.
